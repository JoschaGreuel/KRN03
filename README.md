# KERN Design 2.0

* Features as today desktop application
* Approval
  * Main Purpose of KRN03-project is to have a web application running, stable, performant, nice-to-use
  * Instead of a list of deliverables for approval, there will be weekly meetings to judge and adopt the focus of development
    * A focus is on graphical elements to prove the technology used is suitable
    * Therefore, a screenshot of the application KERN Prozess is also delivered, even if it is not part of this project. It gives the developer an outlook and should help to find the right technology (library / libraries)
    * Drag & Drop is a required feature
    * The possibility to also do every step using only the keyboard would be a plus
      * a big plus :-). And it should also made clear, that there is a generic methodology available to have also future actions in a future application be handled by keyboard only
    * Other features as the possibility to change color design are definitely not required
  * The project is aiming for being a fully standalone worthful solution e.g. to explain business processes in school or university environment
  * after an agreed period (e.g. 3 month) a stable application is judged and experiences made will open the horizon for future development of KERN Process 2.0 
* Modules, objects and activities are fixed within this project
  * it has to be read from external source (database) and can be extended and changed in the future
* The Application comes with 3 predefined processes as showcase (_this part will be delivered by Kern AG_)
  * purchase of one raw material
  * 1-step production
  * selling product

### additional information / future outlook
  * In a future version we need the possibility to be export and import all data according to the BPMN 2.0 model
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation
  * for this project, import/export is not required, but the datamodel has to be prepared accordingly
  * for this project, UI elements + usability is in focus
* Focus on UI
  * the selection of libraries / tools / methods and any other technology is crucial
  * find a screenshot of a related software Kern process and maybe an outlook to where Kern Design 2.0 will evolve and draw the decision of UI technology in regards to the elements visible there
  * take into account the graphical elements of BPMN 2.0

### Code management / IDE
* Github Code repository (here)
* IDE as chosen by Kiterunner / Jawid Jami
* Joscha will provide virtual image for virtualbox to debug the project
