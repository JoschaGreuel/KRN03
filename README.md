# KERN Design 2.0

* Features as today desktop application
* The Application comes with 3 predefined processes as showcase:
  * purchase of one raw material
  * 1-step production
  * selling product
* Approval
  * Main Purpose of KRN03-project is to have a web application running, stable, performant, nice-to-use
  * Instead of a list of deliverables for approval, there will be weekly meetings to judge and adopt the focus of development
    * A focus is on graphical elements to prove the technology used is suitable
    * Therefore, a screenshot of the application KERN Prozess is also delivered, even if it is not part of this project. It gives the developer an outlook and should help to find the right technology (library / libraries)
    * Drag & Drop is an requires feature
    * The possibility to also do every step using only the keyboard would be a plus
      * a big plus :-). And it should also made clear, that there is a generic methodology available to have also future actions in a future application be handled by keyboard only
    * Other features as the possibility to change color design are definitely not required
  * The project is aiming for being a fully standalone worthful solution e.g. to explain business processes in school or university environment
  * after an agreed period (e.g. 3 month) a stable application is judged and will the experiences made will open the horizon for future development of KERN Process 2.0
